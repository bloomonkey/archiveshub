			<h3 class="bar">Searching</h3>
			<div>
				<a name="queries"></a>
				<h4>Queries</h4>
				<p>On the <a href="index.html">main search page</a> you will find a form allowing you to create a search.  
					The 'General Keywords' search looks for your search term(s) in an index which includes the titles, main content and subjects of archival descriptions.
					You can change this index using the drop-down list to a more specific one (e.g. 'Title' or 'Personal Name'), or even the all encompassing 'Full Text'.
					If you are entering more than one word as a search, you can use the second drop-down list to specify whether the system should search for 'All' or 'Any' of your terms, or whether they should be treated as a 'Phrase'.
					When you select an index, the system will automatically select the most appropriate way to treat your terms from the drop-down list, however you may still change this.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Note</strong>: All searches are case-insensitive, so searching for "London" is the same as searching for "london".
					All example queries on this page are intentionally presented in lowercase.
				</p>
				<a name="additionalclause"></a>
				<h5>...Add another search term</h5>
				<p>
					Additional searchs can be specified by clicking on the "...Add another search term" link.
					This will add another search, along with the boolean operators: 'AND', 'OR', and 'NOT'.
					You may select which boolean operator should be used to combine the search clauses (this defaults to 'AND').
					The "...Add another search term" link can be used as many times as necessary to create more complex searches.
				</p>
				<h5>Using Quotation Marks</h5>
				<p>
					You may use quotation marks to delimit a phrase within your search terms when searching 'General Keywords', 'Full Text' or 'Title'.
					For example the following search is legal:<br/>
				<img src="/images/v3_clause.png" alt="[General Keywords] [All] [legal correspondence &quot;john smith&quot;]" /><br/>
					This will only work if you have selected 'All' or 'Any' from the drop-down list.
					If you enter quotations in an 'Exactly' search, then the system will search for the string <em>exactly</em> as you entered it (including the quotation marks).
					You should ensure that you use such quotations in pairs to avoid errors, or unexpected search results.
				</p>
				<h5>Using Wildcards</h5>
				<p>
					You may use wildcards within your search term. These are applicable when searching for words, phrases and exact terms.
					If you wish to use any of these wildcard characters literally (i.e. meaning that character), you must escape it using the backslash (\) character.<br/>
					<strong>N.B.</strong>: While it is possible to use a wildcard as the first character of a term, 
					this is inadvisable as this drastically increases the search response time in the current implementation.<br/>
					Available wildcard characters and their meanings are listed below:
				</p>
				<ul class="unmarked">
					<li>
						A single asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters. 
						This is particularly useful for end truncation of subjects etc, but can also be used in the middle of terms. Examples:
						<ul class="unmarked">
							<li><img src="/images/v3_wildcard1.png" alt="[Subject] [Exactly] [coal min*]" /> will match records with subjects: "coal mines", "coal miners", "coal mining", "coal mining, great britain, wales" etc.<br/></li>
							<li><img src="/images/v3_wildcard2.png" alt="[Title] [Exactly] [the * archive]" /> will match records with titles: "the john smith archive", "the national coal mining archive" etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						A single question mark (?) matches a single character.
						This is particularly useful when searching for words, or names, you know can have variant spellings. Examples:
						<ul class="unmarked">
							<li><img src="/images/v3_wildcard3.png" alt="[General Keywords] [All] [coloni?ation]" /> will match records with keywords: "colonisation", "colonization" etc.</li>
							<li><img src="/images/v3_wildcard4.png" alt="[Personal Name] [All] [sm?th]" /> will match records with personal names: "smith", "smyth" etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Of course, these wildcards can be combined and they will work as one would imagine:
						<ul class="unmarked">
							<li><img src="/images/v3_wildcard5.png" alt="[Personal Name] [All] [sm?th*]" /> will match records with personal names: "smith", "smyth", "smithson", "smythley" etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<a name="nocomponents"></a>
				<h5>Only display collections</h5>
				<p>
					You may also limit your search to display collection descriptions only by using the checkbox provided.
					If you only display collection descriptions, you will be presented with a list of titles of all the collections that contain your search term(s).
					If you do not select this option, you will see the titles of the collections <strong>and</strong> the those of the particular files or items within those collections which contain the search term(s).
					This may be useful if you are interested in a general topic, but do not wish to see detailed descriptions of every single item which matches your search.
					It may also be useful if you are interested in finding out about the history of a particular person or organisation.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<a name="results"></a>
				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>When you submit your search, you should see the results within a few moments.</p>
				<p>The software will tell you how many records matched your search (i.e. how many hits there were), and which it is currently displaying.
					The response should look something like this:
				</p>
				<img src="/images/v3_results.png" alt="[screenshot unavailable]" class="screenshot" title="Screenshot of search results" />
				<p>The first hit displayed above is a collection description, the second a component record.
					Component records can be recognised both by the title of the parent document on the top line in italics, and by the use of the folder icon next to the unit title.
					You will also see a representation of the relevance of this record, represented as either a number of stars out of five, or a percentage.
					There are a number of different display options for each hit.
					A discussion of each of these is included in the <a href="#display">Record Displays</a> section below.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<a name="display"></a>
				<h4>Record Displays</h4>
				<a name="summ"></a>
				<h5>Summary</h5>
				<p>
					For each hit result there are a number of display options.
					The first is to display a summary of the record with your search terms highlighted wherever they were matched.
					This is activated by clicking on the title of the record.
					The summary display contains information specific to the unit of description described by the record, and includes things like title, reference, creator, extent, scope and content, controlled access terms etc.
					In the case of a component, you can view the complete finding aid for the whole archive by clicking on the title of the parent document (i.e. the top line in italics).
				</p>
				<p><strong>N.B.</strong>: if your system administrator has disabled graphical results, the links to the following functions will be in plain text.</p>  

				<a name="full"></a>
				<h5><img src="/images/v3_full.gif" alt="Full-text" title="Full-text display" /></h5>
				<p>This option will return a full-text version of the record, including any and all subordinate units of description.
					In the case of collection-level records which contain subordinate levels of description, this will also include an interactive Table of Contents, which allows you to navigate the record in a hierarchical, rather than linear way.
					Larger records may have to be split into several pages in order for them to be dealt with efficiently during transport, and rendering by the browser. If this is the case, linear page navigation is also available at the top and bottom of each page.
					Please note that it is not possible to achieve search term highlighting in full-text display, due to the potential variation in record size.
				</p>

				<a name="email"></a>
				<h5><img src="/images/v3_email.gif" alt="E-mail" title="E-mail record" /></h5>
				<p>This option allows you to send a text version of the full-text of the record to an email address that you provide.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<a name="similar"></a>
				<h5><img src="/images/v3_simlr.gif" alt="Similar" title="Similar Search" /></h5>
				<p>This option will return records that are considered statistically similar because they contain the same words in  keys areas of the records.
					Areas considered key are, title, creators, scope and content, and controlled access terms.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<a name="browse"></a>
			<h3 class="bar">Browsing Indexes</h3>
			<p>This option allows you to browse through subjects, titles, personal surnames etc. in alphabetical order. Simply choose the type of field to browse, enter your search term or starting letter in the box, and press the Return key or click the 'Browse' button to browse your term and those either side of it. If you do not enter a term to browse for, the system will start browsing at the beginning of the index.</p>
			<p>On the results page, by default 25 index terms will be returned. If the term you entered is present, it should be in the middle in bold type. Clicking on a particular index term will find the records where the term occurs. You can also browse through previous, or subsequent pages of index terms using the links provided.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<a name="resolve"></a>
			<h3 class="bar">Finding Subjects</h3>
			<p>Enter a single word or simple phrase, such as 'Missionaries' or 'World War Two' and hit Return, or click on the submit button.</p>
			<p>A list of related index terms from the UNESCO and/or Library of Congress Subject Headings will be returned, along with a measure of relevance, and the number of records (collections + items) that the subject appears in.
				Clicking on any of these results will perform a search for that term within the subject index.
			</p>
			<p>If you are looking for information on a more specific topic, such as 'Railways in Lancashire', it might be better to go to the <a href="/ead/index.html" title="main search page">Search page</a> and combine your terms using the multiple fields and boolean options available there.</p>
