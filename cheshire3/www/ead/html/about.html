        <h4>Discover</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Search</strong>: The <a href="index.html" title="go to search page">Search</a> page is simple to use, yet allows advanced users to build complex queries with multiple terms in multiple indexes.
            Boolean search logic, phrase searching, and wildcards are all supported, as is highlighting of your search term in record displays wherever possible.
            <br/>
            <strong>Browse</strong>: Indexes of titles, subject, names, reference numbers etc. can be browsed alphabetically from the <a href="browse.html" title="go to browse page">Browse Indexes</a> page.
            <br/>
            <strong>Find subjects</strong>: The system also provides a way to discover relevant subjects within controlled vocabularies based on free text that you enter (known as an <abbr title="Entry Level Vocabulary">ELV</abbr>).
            This is available on the <a href="subject.html" title="go to subject finder">Find Subjects</a> page.
            <br/>
            For full details on the search features and how to use them, please see the <a href="help.html" title="go to help page">Help</a> page.
        </p>
        <h4>Manage</h4>
        <p>
            The database of <abbr title="Encoded Archival Description">EAD</abbr> finding aids can be administered via a web-browser in the authenticated <a href="admin/" title="go to Administration Section">administration interface</a>.
            This provides a multi-user environment for previewing, adding and removing files.
            The database can be rebuilt to allow for bacth addition or deletion of files.
            You can also view a page summarizing a number of statistics relating to how your catalogue is being used, and which entries are most popular.
            The database of users authorized to access the administration section can also be managed within it.
        </p>
        <a name="edit"></a>
        <h4>Create and Edit</h4>
        <p>
            For version 3.4 we&#0039;ve added a data creation and editing interface.
            Based loosely on the Archives Hub data creation template, this new interface allows you to create new catalogue entries from scratch without worrying about schemas or <abbr title="Document Type Definition">DTD</abbr>s.
            The biggest change from the old template is the ability to build up multiple levels of description without needing to copy and paste into a text editor.
            The system will even save your work allowing you to create entries over a number of days or even weeks.
            You can preview your <abbr title="Encoded Archival Description">EAD</abbr> file as it will appear when displayed to users, or look at the raw <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, at any time.
            Once you&#0039;re finished editing you can export your record to a file, and (optionally) submit them for immediate inclusion in the database.
        </p>
        <p>
            It&#0039;s also possible to load one of your existing files into the interface for editing.
            This makes minor corrections, for things such as spelling mistakes, missing, or incorrect controlled access terms a quick and simple task.
            Again, once your edits are complete you can export them to a file and (optionally) immediately replace the existing entry in the database.
        </p>
        <h4>Expose</h4>
        <p>
            As well as a human useable web-interface for searching, it also exposes the database via web services.
        </p>
