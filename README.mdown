Latest Version
--------------

The latest stable version will be available from our website:
http://www.cheshire3.org/download/ead/

Source code is under version control and available from:
http://github.com/cheshire3/cheshire3-ead

Development in the GitHub repository will follow (at least to begin with) 
Vincent Driessen's branching model, and use git-flow to facilitate this. For 
details of the model, see:
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/


Installation
------------

When installing a stable release from our website, please follow the procedure 
outlined on the download page:
http://cheshire3.org/download/ead/index.html#docs

When installing from a clone of the git repository:
1. Run ```python setup.py develop```
2. Change directory to (Cheshire3-base-directory)/cheshire3/www/ead
3. Open localConfig.py in a text editor.
4. Modify preference switches as desired.
5. Replace the values for repository_name, repository_link, repository_logo, 
   localhost, outgoing_email_host.
6. Save and close.
7. Generate customized search pages with the command: ./buildCustomPages.py
8. Restart Apache. This is necessary to load some special configurations for 
   the search interface

OK, you're done! You can now start using the system to index, search, browse, 
and display your EAD finding aids.

##### Available Indexes #####

*   rec.identifier

    Internal identifiers for each record. The values in this index are those 
    used to generate persistent unique URLs for each of the descriptions.

*   cql.anywhere

    All keywords from all records, regardless of their position within records. 
    Using the = relation means search for a phrase in this index.

*   dc.description

    Keywords from specific areas of records that give a good representation of 
    what the records is about. This includes titles, subjects and description 
    of the scope and content of the collect/item in question. Using the = 
    relation means search for a phrase in this index.

*   dc.title

    Precise titles and keywords from titles. Using the exact relation will 
    search for the full and precise title (wildcard are permitted), whereas 
    the other relations will search for keywords, = meaning search for a 
    phrase.

*   dc.identifier

    Unit identifier, or reference number assigned to a collection or item by 
    the cataloguer. Using the any or all relations will match partial 
    identifiers, assuming that they are separated by a non alpha-numerical 
    character.

*   dc.creator

    The name of the creator of the collection or item, as recorded by the 
    cataloguer.

*   dc.subject

    Subjects or topics, as assigned by the cataloguer.

*   bath.name

    Names of things, people, organizations or places.

*   bath.personalName

    Names of people.

*   bath.familyName

    Names of families (surnames)

*   bath.corporateName

    Names of any organizations, corporations or groups.

*   bath.geographicName

    Names of places, towns, regions, countries etc.

*   bath.genreForm

    Types of media represented in the collection or item, e.g. photographs, 
    audio recordings etc.

*   dc.date

    Significant dates, most commonly the date of creation of the material.

*   rec.creationDate

    The date and time at which the record was inserted into the database. 
    Please note that this is not the same as the date the EAD description was 
    created, nor is it guaranteed to remain unaltered; occasionally it may be 
    necessary to completely recreate the indexes, which will result in the 
    record creation time being updated.

*   rec.lastModifiedDate

    The date and time at which the index entries for the description were last 
    updated. Please note that this is not necessarily the same as the date the 
    content of the record was modified, nor does it guaranteed that the record 
    was actually altered at this time; occasionally it may be necessary to 
    reindex, which will result in the last modification time being updated, 
    as it is not practical to test every record for the presence of actual 
    modifications.

*   ead.istoplevel

    Values in this index are all 1. This index is used as a filter to 
    discriminate collections from the items contained within them.
