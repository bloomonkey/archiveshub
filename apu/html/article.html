         <h2>Tories protest at history shift</h2>
         <p><span><span>(1) </span>The government was yesterday at the centre of a fresh row over plans for a shake-up in the way history is taught in schools,
               after the Tories joined forces with traditionalist history experts to accuse Labour of undermining Britain's national identity.</span></p>
         <p><span><span>(2) </span>Under changes to the national curriculum which will be introduced next year, there will be no compulsory study at primary
               schools of named individuals such as kings and queens, or landmark events such as battles or acts of parliament.</span></p>
         <p><span><span>(3) </span>Primary schoolchildren will be required to study three, rather than four periods of British history.</span> <span><span>(4) </span>And the current requirement for secondary school pupils to study British history from 1066 to the 20th century in strict chronological
               order is being scrapped in order to give schools more flexibility.</span> <span><span>(5) </span>History will be compulsory only between the ages of 11 and 14.</span></p>
         <p><span><span>(6) </span>The History Curriculum Association yesterday demanded the proposals be withdrawn immediately before history teaching became
               a `free for all'.</span></p>
         <p><span><span>(7) </span>It launched an alternative manifesto in a `final attempt to restore to the children of this country their birthright - a sense
               of identity'.</span></p>
         <p><span><span>(8) </span>Its concerns were echoed by the shadow education spokeswoman, Theresa May, who said: `Teaching our children the history of
               our country is a very important part of education.</span> <span><span>(9) </span>It gives schoolchildren a sense of national identity and of what has made this country what it is today.</span> <span><span>(10) </span>It shows that under Labour, even history is history.</span> <span><span>(11) </span>It seems odd that these proposals have come out so quickly after the end of the consultation.</span> <span><span>(12) </span>What we see is an attempt to pretend that all in the garden is rosy, when clearly it is not.'</span></p>
         <p><span><span>(13) </span>The qualifications and curriculum authority, which advises the government on the content of the curriculum, said the controversial
               revisions were being made to reduce prescriptive detail and to give schools more flexibility.</span></p>
         <p><span><span>(14) </span>But history experts fear the plans will further dilute youngsters' understanding and interest in the key events that have
               led to the creation of modern society.</span></p>
         <p><span><span>(15) </span>Chris McGovern, director of the HCA, said: `If adopted, these proposals will destroy history as a subject that has traditionally
               given schoolchildren a sense of national identity.</span> <span><span>(16) </span>History teaching will become a free-for-all.'</span></p>
         <p><span><span>(17) </span>But the government strongly defended the proposals, claiming the criticism was based on a `misleading view' of the curriculum
               revision.</span></p>
         <p><span><span>(18) </span>A spokesman for the department for education and employment said the education secretary, David Blunkett, had insisted that
               children would continue to study `key person alities and monarchs like Queen Elizabeth I and King Henry VIII'.</span></p>
         <p><span><span>(19) </span>The education minister, Estelle Morris, said: `It is sheer nonsense to say that every king, queen, hero, battle and historical
               date will be eliminated from the national curriculum.</span> <span><span>(20) </span>Pupils will learn about the reasons for and the results of historical events and situations.</span> <span><span>(21) </span>It will also be compulsory for pupils to develop a chronological understanding of the events, people and changes in the appropriate
               period of history.'</span></p>
         <p><span><span>(22) </span>She stressed: `Our priority for the national curriculum is to ensure that important key events and historical figures and
               developments in British history will be retained.</span> <span><span>(23) </span>This will ensure that pupils learn the richness of British history.'</span></p>
         <p><span><span>(24) </span>Last month Mr Blunkett ordered an investigation into the decision by exam boards to drop Anglo-Saxon history from the A-level
               syllabus.</span></p>
         <p>- <span><span>(25) </span>MPs are to launch an investigation into computer problems which have delayed the handling of student loan applications.</span></p>
         <p><span><span>(26) </span>Ministers have insisted that the glitches will be solved in time for undergraduates to get their maintenance cheques for the
               start of the academic year in the autumn.</span></p>
         <p><span><span>(27) </span>The all-party Commons select committee plans to interview officials from the department for education and employment to uncover
               the full facts about the situation.</span></p>
