========

Description
-----------

XSLT used by [cheshire3-archives][1], the [Archives Hub][2] and related
projects to transform EAD.

Installation
------------

This section provides some pointers on how to integrate into other projects in
various version control systems. `path/to/xslt` represent the path where you
want to embed the XSLT relative to (and assuming you will run the commands from)
your project's root.


### Git


I'd recommend the [git subtree command][3], rather than [subtree merging][4]
strategy, or [submodules][5]. I'd also recommend reading up on the
[git subtree command][3] before blindly continuing with the following steps;
I'm far from an expert in git, and you should really read up on and understand
what you're getting into...

```shell
git remote add ead-xslt git@github.com:cheshire3/ead-xslt.git
git fetch ead-xslt
git subtree add [--squash] --prefix=path/to/xslt ead-xslt HEAD
```

To fetch future updates:

```shell
git subtree pull [--squash] --prefix=path/to/xslt ead-xslt
```

### Mercurial


Create a [Mercurial subrepository][6]. I'd highly recommend reading up on
[Mercurial Subrepositories][6] before blindly continuing with the following
steps; I'm a relative novice with Mercurial, and you should **really** read up
on what you're getting into...

```shell
echo "nested = [git]git://github.com/cheshire3/ead-xslt.git" > .hgsub
hg add .hgsub
git clone git://github.com/cheshire3/ead-xslt.git path/to/xslt
hg commit -m "adding XSLT subrepository" 
```

To fetch future updates:

```shell
cd path/to/xslt
hg pull
hg update
```
